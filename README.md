A Java code sample to show my thought process of creating Java code.  Most of the classes are auto-generated from a JSON emitter.  This may not be a DRY method, however it is very quick to develop.

There are Junit test classes to show Test Driven Design.  The code is considered complete when the tests classes run correctly.
